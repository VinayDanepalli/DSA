# DSA
* Data Structures and Algorithms using C++ and / or Python

___ 

## Goal 
* Firstly, build foundations by learning basic algorithms and concepts
* Secondly, keep learning new algorithms to add to build problem solving skills 
* Finally, get comfortable with DSA and problem solving.

## Roadmap
